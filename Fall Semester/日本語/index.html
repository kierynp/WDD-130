                    When you decide to begin studying Japanese, it can get very overwhelming and very confusing very quickly. When I first began to learn it, I wasn’t quite sure where to start. Do I begin with kanji? If hiragana is the phonetic language, what is the set of characters that is neither hiragana nor kanji? How does kanji even work? I know a few different vocabulary words, but how do I put together a sentence in Japanese? These are a few questions I’ve experienced difficulty with and have heard others ask about.

                    Obviously, there are many different approaches to learning a language. I am hoping this can be used as a very simple, easy-to-follow, and well-rounded guide to the very basics of Japanese, without any superfluous information. If this guide isn’t thorough enough, or you’re looking to get past the basics, some helpful websites/textbooks are provided! がんばってね!
